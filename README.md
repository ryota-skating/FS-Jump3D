# FS-Jump3D Dataset

This is the official repository for `FS-Jump3D` dataset.

`FS-Jump3D` dataset is the first figure skating jump dataset that includes both 3D pose data and video data from 12 viewpoints. The jump data were captured using the markerless motion-capture system (Theia3D, Theia) by positioning 12 high-speed cameras (Miqus Video, Qualisys) on the ice skating rink.
