# FS-Jump3D Dataset

This is the official repository for the `FS-Jump3D` Dataset.

`FS-Jump3D` dataset is the first figure skating jump dataset consisting of 3D pose data and video data from 12 viewpoints. Data are captured with the markerless motion-capture system (Theia3D, Theia) by placing twelve high-speed cameras (Miqus Video, Qualisys) on the ice skate rink.
